    For 0 <= I < 129, R = I
    For 129 <= I < 225,

Skateboard wall mount

My son got a great looking skateboard for Christmas. We haven't mastered it yet and it's almost too pretty to ride. We needed a place to mount it out of the way but also admire it so here is a little bracket that screws in to the wall and supports the board under the front truck. Not much to it but it isn't too ugly when the board is not hanging since it looks a little like a good luck horse shoe. The design is on Thingiverse in case anyone wants to adjust the screw holes used for mounting.
